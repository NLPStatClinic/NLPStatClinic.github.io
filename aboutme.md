title: About Me
---

My name is Rotem Dror. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Cognitive Computation Group](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/) at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/).

My research involves developing statistically sound methodologies for empirical investigation and evaluation for Data Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing applications.
My goal is to ensure that researchers implement statistically valid methods to verify the outcomes of their experiments so that their publications will be meaningful and impactful.
