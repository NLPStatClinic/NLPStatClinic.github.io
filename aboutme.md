title: About Me
---

My name is Rotem Dror. I am a postdoctoral researcher at the [Cognitive Computation Group](https://cogcomp.seas.upenn.edu/) at the [Department of Computer and Information Science](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/), [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.upenn.edu/).


My research involves developing statistically sound methodologies for empirical investigation and evaluation for Data Science with a focus on Natural Language Processing applications.

The goal of this page is to help researchers implement statistically valid methods to verify the outcomes of their experiments so that their publications will be meaningful and impactful.
More details about me can be found [here](https://rtmdrr.github.io).

This initiative was created out of discussions between Ada Wan and myself. I would like to thank Ada personally for the intriguing and thought-provoking discussions, for her help, and for her feedback.
